LinkedIn Job Search and Apply Bot


This project is a LinkedIn Job Search and Apply Bot that automates the process of searching for jobs on LinkedIn and applying to them. The bot utilizes AI to evaluate whether you have a high chance of securing the job before applying. Additionally, if any job application asks questions, the bot will use your YAML-formatted resume to provide relevant answers.

Features
    - Automated Job Search: The bot automatically searches for jobs based on your preferred keywords, location, and other filters.
    - AI-Powered Job Evaluation: The bot uses an AI algorithm to analyze the job description and compare it to your skills and experience, ensuring a higher likelihood of success before applying.
    - Automated Job Application: Once a suitable job is found, the bot automatically fills in application forms with your details (e.g., resume, cover letter).
    - YAML Resume Integration: The bot extracts details from your resume stored in a YAML format and uses this information to respond to job-specific questions during the application process.

How It Works
    - Login: The bot logs into your LinkedIn account using your credentials.
    - Search for Jobs: The bot searches for jobs using specified keywords and location filters.
    - AI Evaluation: The bot assesses each job listing to determine if you have a high probability of securing the position based on the job description and your resume.
    - Application: If the AI evaluates that you are a strong match, the bot automatically applies to the job by filling in the application form.
    - Answering Questions: If the job application asks any specific questions, the bot will refer to your YAML resume to provide appropriate responses.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
    - Selenium: For automating web interactions with LinkedIn.
    - WebDriver Manager: For automatically managing the appropriate WebDriver version for your browser.
    - AI Model: A simple AI evaluation model (could be a custom machine learning model or an API like OpenAI).
    - YAML Resume: Your resume should be formatted in YAML for the bot to extract information.
    LinkedIn Account: Your LinkedIn credentials (email and password) for login.
